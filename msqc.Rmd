This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(spdep)
library(ggplot2)
```



```{r}
# LOAD CSV
datapath = '/Users/changlu/DATA/sma-ffpe/peakcsv'
csv_files <- list.files(path = datapath, pattern = "\\.csv$", full.names = TRUE)
csv_names <- tools::file_path_sans_ext(list.files(path = datapath, pattern = "\\.csv$", full.names = FALSE))
```


# calculate moran I per m/z, save it as .csv files
```{r}
moran_mean =  vector("list", length = 5)

  peak_df <- read.csv(csv_files[i])
  coords <- peak_df[, c("x", "y")]
  nb <- knn2nb(knearneigh(coords, k = 4))  # k = 4 is for the 4 nearest neighbors
  listw <- nb2listw(nb, style = "W")  # W is the weight style (row-standardized)
  # Calculate Moran's I for all columns except x and y
  morans_I_results <- sapply(colnames(peak_df)[!(colnames(peak_df) %in% c("x", "y"))], function(col) {
    a = moran.test(peak_df[,col], listw)

  })
  rownames(morans_I_results)[5] <- 'pvalue'
  morans_I_results <- t(morans_I_results)
  write.csv(morans_I_results, file=paste0('/Users/changlu/DATA/sma-ffpe/resultCL/', csv_names[i],'.csv'))

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
